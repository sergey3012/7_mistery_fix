# Script for solving of Quadratic equation
This script allows to solve different quadratic equation. Quadratic equation has view: ax**2 + bx + c = 0.

At first, the script calculate Discriminant's value.

Depending on Discriminant's value (D), the script returns 3 options of roots.

In case if D = 0, the script returns 1 root.

In case if D>  0, the script returns 2 roots.

In other case, the script returns None roots. 

In script there are 2 files: quadratic_equation.py - for solving equation and tests.py - for testing script.

# How to use
For solving equation, you have to launch file: quadratic_equation.py. Then launch function get_roots(a, b, c), where a, b, c - coefficients of quation. At the end script returns roots of equation(detail explanation returning of roots you'll find in description of the script).

For checking, you have to launch file: tests.py.


# How to launch tests

python tests.py
