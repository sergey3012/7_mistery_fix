# Script for solving of Quadratic equation
This script allows to solve different quadratic equation. Depending on Discriminant's value, the script returns 3 options of roots.
in case if discriminant equals Zero, the script returns 1 root.
in case if discriminant more than Zero, the script returns 2 roots.
in other case, the script returns None roots. 
There are 2 files: quadratic_equation.py - for solving equation and tests.py - for testing script

# How to use
for solving equation, you have to launch file: quadratic_equation.py
for checking, you have to launch file: tests.py


# How to launch tests

python tests.py
